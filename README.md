# 08 TypeScript and OOP: Vehicle Builder

## Summary

For this assignment, I finished the framework of a unqiue vehicle generator and added the ability to tow and untow cars specifically for trucks, and the ability for motorbikes for cars. This was a good learnign experience for me, as I learned a lot more about typescript funtions and the inner workings of using interfaces and modules.
### User Story

```md
AS a developer
I WANT to update an existing application to include additional vehicle types
SO THAT I am able to comprehend and work with existing code bases.
```

## üìù Notes

You can techinically go as fast as you want with your vehicle, but it doesn't affect the code.
